Changes:

Build 125
2022-01-23
- included splash screen by KAZ


Build 124
2013-12-21
- removed large chunk of redundant 4x4 print code and table generation code,
  over 1kb gained.
- plot and point routines speeded up by ~20 cycles :P (and shortened by few bytes as well)
- fixed bug 011. High flying bullets sometimes cause brief screen garbage - like a DL damaged
  fixed by plotpointer (the top line) changed from HSCROLL based to regular $f line with plot
- screen memory moved to low area ($1010), making the game start at $3010 and easier
  to be loaded. Other minor memory layout modifications.

Build 123
2013-12-10
- fixed bug 013: sometimes demo mode does not work (it stops on results display)
- fixed bug 012: (newly introduced) Death explosions are offset right and possibly up.
- prepared the game for various screen width. The only problem is memory layout.
  Basically it is impossible to make contiguous wide screen of more than 170 lines.
  Changing the screen to non-contiguous would require rewrite of all character
  manipulating routines.
- fixed bug 014: FunkyBomb shoots with too high angle, 
  funkyBomb angle changed from -8..+8 to -16..+16
- speeded up explosions by drawing only odd circles. Not bad visually and 2x faster.

Build 122
2013-11-17
- tank expend 1 energy with each shoot to avoid endless shooting loops
- small visual glitch with background colour fixed
- death messages "defensive texts" in source do not stay on screen after some explosions

Build 121
2013-11-10
- Poolshark and Shooter can buy weapons
- Purchase screen moved to the beginning of the round

Build 120
2013-11-09
SillyVenture 2K13 joint effort to bring artificial intelligence into life:
- Shooter and Poolshark shooting programmed
- several small bugfixes and improvements as proposed by SillyVenture crowd 

Build 119
2012-06-17
Scorch sources translated to MADS with the sweet repl.sh script.

MISSING UPDATE INFORMATION... POSSIBLY NOTHING IMPORTANT HAPPENED HERE.

Build 115
2009-08-25
- fixed bug 001 (lack of explosions on the empty ground)
- fixed bug 003 (wrapping death's head explosions)
- fixed plot (faster explosions)
- fukk, just 6 years and we are back!!! This game is pretty addictive :)
TO DO:
- send our wives and kids away much more often :))))

Build 114
2003-08-22
- Results after each round are displayed in the right
  sequence, i.e. the best one is on the top
- during second and following rounds shooting sequence
  is such that the worst tank shoots first
The above changes does not look terrific, but there was
a lot of thinking to do it correctly. What is the most
important the overall game feeling improved a lot!

program.s65
	* added routine SortSequence
textproc.s65
	* changed routine DisplayResults to show
	  round results in correct order

Build 113
2003-08-17
- AI Opponents move barrels to the right position
  before firing a bullet.
- Purchase screen is not displayed for AI opponents.
- There is 2 sec delay after displaying
  "Deffensive" text i.e. text before death

program.s65
	* added routine MoveBarrelToNewPosition
	  which rotates barrel of the tank until
	  it sits at the right (newly randomized) angle
textproc.s65
	* added routine PurchaseAI
	  it is a framework for all AI purchases
SHORTSYS.S65
	* new macro PAUSE (waits given number of frames)

First attempts to create a framework for intelligent
opponents (AI). Right now there is only one level
of "intelligence" - Moron. Moron shoots at random angle
with random force.

program.s65
	* routine Round checks the Skill level
	  and if it is not human branches to
	  ArtificialIntelligence routine.
	* new routines:
	  - ArtificialIntelligence
	  - RandomizeForce
	  - RandomizeAngle

TO DO:
	* nice rotating barrel of AI tank
	* AI weapon purchase and usage
	* AI better than Moronic... (but how...)
	* tanks' shooting seqence shoud be from
	  weakest to the strongest, not random

Bulid 111
2003-07-27

program.s65:
	* added sequentional shooting
	  (not necessarily tank no. 1 shoots first)
	* added routine "RandomizeSequence" that is called
	  before each round
	* initial angle of the tank's barrel is randomized
	  (was always 45 degrees right)
variables.s65
	* added table "TankSequence"
grafproc.s65
	* shorter delay during Flight
