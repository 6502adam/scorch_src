TODO and BUGS file
rev. 2013-11-17

---------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs (+ means bug is fixed)
+001. when bullet goes straight down very fast it misses the tank
     it happens only when tank is standing on the bottom of
     the screen (no groud below)
+002. points after the round are not calculated correctly
+003. if death's head explodes low, the lowest explosion wraps
     and appears on the top of the screen
004. when parachute is on and the tank dies (e.g. hit by a powerful
     weapon) the dead (invisible) tank falls on parachute
     (and uses one parachute more than necessary)
005. tank stands still on a one pixel spike - it should fall
     (possibly all that is necessary is adjust of WhereToSlideTable)
006. After some attacks (like MIRV and leapfrog    the OffensiveText 
     stays on the screen (and becomes a static decoration)
     It possibly happens when a tank kills itself with mirv or leapfrog.
007. Decreasing of number of bullets after a shoot does not work correctly
     (e.g. 2 bullets are deducted instead of 1)
+008. After a round the last tank sprite stays on the screen. 
     This hurts only when the last tank is under the table with results!
009. When result in points is >99 then only 2 first digits are displayed
+010. Even MORONS shoot their feet too often - increase min. randomised energy.
+011. High flying bullets sometimes cause brief screen garbage - like a DL damaged
     for a fraction of a frame.
     Update - these are NOT high flying bullets - it just happens during bullet flight
+012. (newly introduced) Death explosions are offset right and possibly up.
+013. sometimes demo mode does not work (it stops on results display)
+014: FunkyBomb shoots with too high angle
015: Only first shoot of FunkyBomb is correct (with smoke and fast), 
     the next are like missiles
016: Additional explosions after Frogger are not fallen down
017: Observed MIRV loops - it shoots and shoots MIRV all over the screen. Very rare.
-018: MINOR: ydraw, yhit, ybyte variable is sometimes treated as WORD, sometimes as BYTE. 
     Making it consistent would save both time and space (not much)
     REJECTED: too much work - different routines depend on checking high byte. 
---------------------------------------------------------
To do
+001. Start each round with a)worst tank or b)random tank
      (Worst tank starts first)
+002. Start each round with random angles (not always 45 degrees left)
+003. Add colour of the given tank to the screen
     E.g. when a given tank is shooting it's colour could be behind
     tank name on the text screen
004. The game has no end!!! Add ending!!!
     A good idea for an ending - a TIP pic - Red Army taking Berlin :)
	 Another - vector tanks like in BattleZone
	 Another - stickman tankmen
005. Add number of rounds to the options menu
006. Add sound effects (maybe sampled? or mp0 (sound based on fft))
007. There is no deffensive weapon handling (only parachute works,
     but also provisionally
+008. No computer operated opponents - make a frame for AI!!!
009. Make AI in the existing frame
010. It is impossible to look up a number of parachutes left.
+011. Colouring the top status lines in a colour of the active tank.
012. Decreased number of bullets should be displayed just after the shoot.
013. Check LineTable - possibly it is unnecessarily long
+014. Demo mode - when all tanks are CPUs let them play non-stop!
     (replace waiting for a key-press after a round with a small delay)
+015. Switch to mads for easier development (mads speeds it up, no doubt)
016. Speed up death's head (e.g.: draw each second circle)
-017. Wide screen mode (with scroll?)
018. Speed up soil down after soil eating weapons - correctly calculate 
     ranges as now range is very broad even when very little soil is eaten.
